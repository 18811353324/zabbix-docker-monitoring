# Contribution Guidelines

**Development*
- Fork the repository.
- Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature master`).
- Commit your changes, preferring one commit per logical unit of work. Often times, this simply means having a single commit.
- If applicable, update the documentation in the [README file](README.md).
- In the vast majority of cases, you should test your bug fix/feature.
- Push your branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`).
- Create a new pull request.
- Address any comments your reviewer raises, pushing additional commits onto your branch along the way.
